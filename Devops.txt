DEVOPS:
--------
	Devops is a combination of two words development and operations team.This allows a single team to handle the entire application lifecycle
from development to test,deployment and operations.
	Devops provides connection between development and operations team to deploy code to production faster in an automated and repeatable way.
	It helps to increase organization speed to deliver applications and services.
	With the help of devops,quality and speed of the application delivery has been improved.

Devops Architecture:
---------------------
	It mainly consists of Automation,Collaboration,Integration,Configuration management
